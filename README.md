# TrelloApp-Clone
A basic clone of the trello app for use by one person

To run this app
You need to have node installed

Navigate to your local trello app directory and run the following commands

`npm install` to install the dependencies

and then 

`npm start`

'head to `http://localhost:3000` to use the app. Remember to enjoy!!!

The app is set up to work with nodemon to allow for code improvement, so you can navigate to the package.json file and change start to kickup
with node. Sometimes when a query is made to the server and changes are made to files nodemon restarts so, if you are make another query
while its restarting, the connection will be denied.
